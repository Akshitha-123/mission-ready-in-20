    "PURPOSE": "of this event is to certify all squads during LFX conditions and set conditions for PLT LFX and STX. Decisive to this event is the completion of blank fire. This is decisive because it will ensure squads are prepared to advance to the live fire iteration. We assume tactical risk by using live ammunition. We will mitigate this risk through planning, rehearsals, range safeties, and proper wear of PPE.\nTraining Objectives Conduct Day and Night Squad Live Fire Exercises",

At PL Red, the Squad will tactically dismount and clear along AOA 1 until reaching PL Orange, located at the pre-identified RP IVO 32U QA 0865 0717. Once crossing Phase Line Orange, the squad will establish the RP. Once the Squad receives confirmation that both SBF1 and SBF2 are established they will continue down DOA 2 to their pre-identified Assault Position IVO 32U QA 0860 0704. Once established in their Assault Position, SBF 1 will initiate fire between TRPs 7-8 and SBF 2 will initiate between TRPs 2-6. This will be the trigger for the Squad to continue down DOA 2 crossing PL Yellow located at LDA B. (during iterations where SBF1 is occupied by an ICVD rather than an ICVJ, no movement will occur past LDA B until confirmation has been received that SBF1 has lifted fire).\nAfter crossing PL Yellow, the squad will assault down DOA 3, eliminate maneuvering enemy dismounts, establish a local support by fire at SBF3, engage targets between TRPs 2-6, and conduct a battlefield handover with SBF 2. After completion of the battlefield handover SBF 3 will shift fire to TRPs 1-2 and SBF 2 will shift fire to TRPs 5-6. The confirmation that SBF2 and SBF3 have shifted fire is the trigger for the Assault Squad’s entrance Team to maneuver along DOA 4 and enter and clear the trench crossing PL Green located along LDA C.\nN\nDOA Z\nDOA Y\nAssault Squad Sequence\nDOA 1\nDOA 2\nDOA 4\nDOA 5\nAOA 1\nRP\nASLT POS\nLDA A\nLDA B\nLDA C\nDOA 3\nLDA D\nLDA D\nMount Point 1\nLDA E\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nTRP 1\nTRP 2\nTRP 3\nTRP 5\nTRP 6\nTRP 4\nSequence\nAfter crossing PL Green, the entrance team will prepare the trench with a frag grenade (Fuse Simulator), enter the trench, secure a foothold, and signal for the trail team to enter the trench. The squad will clear the trench eliminating three targets. Once complete they will communicate over radio with the Platoon Leader. The Platoon Leader will order them to prepare to tactically mount in their vehicle. The Squad will establish a security position allowing the vehicle to move to the Mount Point. After the Stryker crosses the intersection of LDA D and E, the Assault Squad will gain visual contact with the enemy vehicle target and engage with AT4 (subcal).\nOnce the vehicle threat has been eliminated, the Stryker will continue down DOA 6, pick up the dismounts at Mount Point 1, and exfil along DOA 6.\nN\nDOA Z\nDOA Y\nWeapon Squad Sequence\nDOA 1\nAOA 1\nRP\nLDA A\nLDA B\nLDA C\nLDA D\nDOA 6\nDOA Z\nDOA Y\nMount Point 2\nTRP 1\nTRP 2\nTRP 3\nTRP 5\nTRP 6\nDOA 6\nTRP 4\nSequence\nThe Weapon Squad will continue down DOA 1 until reaching PL Red located at the intersection IVO 32U QA 0885 0710. At PL Red, the Squad will tactically dismount and clear along AOA 1 until reaching PL Orange, located at the pre-identified RP IVO 32U QA 0865 0717. Once crossing Phase Line Orange, the squad will establish the RP. Once the RP is established, they will receive confirmation that the mortar fire on the trench has ceased. SBF1 will also conduct fire one engagement, and no movement will occur past LDA B until the ICVJ or ICVD has lifted fire. The Weapon Squad will then progress along DOA Z crossing PL Yellow, located along LDA B.\nAfter crossing PL Yellow, the squad will eliminate one enemy dismount, hastily establish SBF2, and engage targets between TRPs 2-6. After receiving confirmation that SBF2 (notional) is established they will conduct a battlefield handover with SBF2 (notional) and shift fire to TRPs 5-6. They will then receive confirmation that the Assault Squad is in the trench, which will be their trigger to cease fire.\nUpon confirmation that the Assault Squad has cleared the trench, the Weapon Squad will cease fire then displace from SBF1 to SBF2 along DOA Y. Once they are established in SBF2 they will begin suppressing targets between TRPs 1-3. Upon confirmation that the Assault Squad has mounted at Mount Point 1, the Weapon Squad will move along DOA W to Mount Point 2, tactically mount, and exfil.\nN\nPL Orange\nDOA Z\nAssault Squad Engagements\nDOA 1\nDOA 2\nDOA 4\nDOA 5\nAOA 1\nRP\nASLT POS\nLDA A\nLDA B\nLDA C\nDOA 3\nLDA D\nLDA D\nMount Point 1\nLDA E\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nEngagements – M4 / M249\nPL Red: P10 PL Yellow: Single: PM6 TRPs 2-6: P24, P25, P26, P32, IN-M7, IN-M10 Shift Fire: TRPs 1-2: P27, P28, IN-M8\nPL Green:\nTrench: TSR: 1,2,3\nVic MVMT / PL Blue:\nSecurity Position: V5\nDOA 6\nTRP 1\nTRP 2\nTRP 3\nTRP 5\nTRP 6\nTRP 4\nN\nDOA Z\nDOA Y\nWeapon Squad Engagements\nDOA 1\nAOA 1\nRP\nLDA A\nLDA B\nLDA C\nLDA D\nDOA 6\nDOA Z\nDOA Y\nMount Point 2\nTRP 1\nTRP 2\nTRP 3\nTRP 5\nTRP 6\nDOA 6\nTRP 4\nDOA 6\nEngagements – M240 / M4\nPL Red: Single: P10 SBF2: TRPs 2-6: P23, P24, P25, P26, P29, P32, IN-M7, IN-M9, IN-M10\nTRPs 5-6: P23, P25, IN-M7\nDisplacement: Single: PM6\nSBF3: TRPs 1-3 : P26, P27, P28, P29, IN-M8, IN-M10\n.\nN\nPL Orange\nDOA Z\nWeapon Squad Engagements\nDOA 1\nAOA 1\nRP\nLDA A\nLDA B\nLDA C\nLDA D\nLDA D\nLDA E\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nDOA Z\nDOA Y\nMount Point 2\nDOA W\nTRP 1\nTRP 2\nTRP 3\nTRP 5\nTRP 6\nDOA 6\nEngagements – M240 / M4\nPL Red: Single: P10 SBF2: TRPs 2-6: P23, P24, P25, P26, P29, P32, IN-M7, IN-M9, IN-M10\nTRPs 5-6: P23, P25, IN-M7\nDisplacement: Single: PM6\nSBF3: TRPs 1-3 : P26, P27, P28, P29, IN-M8, IN-M10\nTRP 4\nDOA 6\nN\nVehicle Engagements\nEngagements – .50 Cal and 30mm\nSBF1 Established TRPs 7-8: Engagement 1: P42.1, V8\nEngagement 2: V11, V9\nMount Point 2\nDOA 6\nMount Point 1\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nDOA 6\nVDO\nTRP 6\nTRP 7\nTRP 8\nN"
