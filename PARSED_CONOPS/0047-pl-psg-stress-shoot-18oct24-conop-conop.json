Phase I: Setup. Firers line up 5 meters behind their rifles (which are laying in the firing position pointed down range) with three 5-round magazines in their full dragoon standard (minus pro mask) and await the order of the tower to begin. Tower places the targets on “bob.” Phase II: Stressor. Tower announces to firers to begin. Safeties start their timer. Each lane completes 10 burpees over a sandbag and then farmer carries two full water cans to each end of the firing line and then returns to their station.\nPhase III: Shooting. Firers pick up their rifle and load their first 5-round magazine to engage their targets from either the standing-supported or kneeling-supported position. Each of the targets only needs to go down once. Safeties will call out hits. Once empty, transition to the second 5-round magazine and assume the prone-unsupported position. If there are targets remaining, load the third 5-round magazine and assume the prone-supported position. Time stops when either out of ammo or all seven targets have been successfully engaged.\nStress Shoot\nLane 1\nLane 2\nLane 3\nLane 4\nLane 5\nLane 6\nFarmers Carry (Lane 4 Route)\nLane Setup (Lane 4 Example)\nLegend- = Sandbang Burpee Area = Firing Position = Outgoing Direction = Incoming Direction",
